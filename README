# TwitterMap - ly2331
The project is written in Python, HTML and Javascript.
Database that I use is PostgreSQL, a relational database just like MySQL.
For web framework, I use FLASK.
To reflect twits distribution, I always pick the latest 500 twits to be shown.

There are three major files for this project:
1. getTwitterData.py 
It uses Twitter Streaming API to gain twits. And writes them to the database.
This program is run as daemon.
2. hello.py
It's the main program for web server.
3. twitMap.html
In this script, I use Ajax to realize keeping data on the map change as time.
Different keywords can be selected.

The database is deployed on Amazon AWS RDS, and the two programs are deployed on EC2 instance.
