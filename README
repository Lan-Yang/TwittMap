# TwitterMap
The project is written in Python, HTML and Javascript. I used PostgreSQL to store tweet ID, longitude, latitude, 
content, time (UTC). For web framework, I used FLASK. To reflect tweets distribution in near real time, I always pick  
tweets published in last 3 minutes.

There are three major files for this project:
1. getTwitterData.py 
Used Twitter Streaming API to fetch tweets and writes relational data to the database.
This program is run as daemon, guaranteed by cron.
2. application.py
Main program for web server.
3. templates/twitMap.html
Client html page, used Ajax for polling real-time tweet data, provided by JQuery library.
Different keywords can be selected.

The database is deployed on Amazon AWS RDS, application is deployed on Elastic BeanStalk, can be visited at http://twitmap-env-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
